# PokeApp

First of all, I want to thank my dear friend @lucasmacielc. He is an inspiration for me to want to keep getting better. You can check his page here: https://github.com/lucasmacielc

This is an app for my study of android development.

The main goal is to learn and apply the best solutions using:

- Jetpack Compose
- MVVM
- Paging library 3 
- Room
- Tests

My plan for this journey is to have different versions of the same app. Each version improving based on the latter.
For the first version (and most simple) I want to implement the following:

### Main page

Is a simple screen where the user can find the pokémon of the day (rule to be decided) and also a search option. The search is going to be based on the first 151 pokémons created (Gen 1).
Through this screen the user is going to be able to access the pókemon details and also set add or remove pokémons as favorites.

### Favorite pokémons page

Here the user is going to have access to the list of his favorite pokémons. He is going to be able to search and remove pokémons as favorites, aswell as accessing the details screen.

### Pokémon details page

This page is where the bulk of the pokémon information is going to be. In this page you can also add/remove pokémon as favorites.

## API

All versions are planned to use the PokeApi:
